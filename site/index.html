<p>As a little primer:
    you can make the "id" of an HTML element by declaring it's id  inside of it's tag. This specifies a completely unique element. 
    
  <!--This is a comment. below is two line breaks.-->
    <br><br>
    
    These are edited in jQuery and CSS using the #idElement syntax.
    
      <br><br>
    
    you can make the "class" of an element, likewise, by declaring it's class, and edit it using the .class syntax. 
    
      <br><br>
    
    Elements can have both  id's and classes. 
  
  <ol>
    <li>task 1</li>
    <li>task 2</li>
    <li>task 3</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h1 class = "redH1"> This is going to be a red H1.</h1>
  <h1 class = "redH1"> So is this.</h1>
  
  <h1 class = "blueText">Now, even though this is also an H1, I can give it a new class to declare a new set of similar elements. I'm not even necessarily limited by H1, I can just give elements the class "blueText" and define its qualities in my css. </h1>
  
  <p class = "blueText"> See, now this is blue too. Just like the h1 up top.</p>
  <button id = "myButton">Click me!</button>
  
  <p id = "buttonDescription">Button not clicked</p>
